// Welcome! Here's an example of a console logged response
console.log(4 + 5);

/***********************/
/* Using Expressions   */
/***********************/

//1.) Log an expression that evaluates to the sum of two integers
let a = (4+3)
console.log(a);

// 2.) log an expression that evaluates to the difference of two integers
let b = (5-4)
console.log(b);

// 3.) Log an expression that concatenates the two strings "I'm writing" and "my first JavaScript code"
let c = ("I'm writing " + "my first Javascript code")
console.log(c);

// 4.) Log an expression that evaluates to true or false using two numbers that are greater or less than eachother
let d = (4<5)
console.log(d);

// 5.) Log an expression that uses modulo, with a result of 4
let e = (14%5)
console.log(e);

// 6.) Create two different strings and compare them, logging the result.
let f = ("This is a string" == "This is also a string")
console.log(f);

// 7.) Concatenate 4 different strings to form the sentence "I'm learning a bit of JavaScript at Kenzie"
console.log("I'm learning " + "a bit " + "of Javascript " + "at Kenzie");

// 8.) Uncomment this code and create an expression inside of it.
// The expression should represent: 5 is less than 10 and 8 is greater than 5
// This should print true

console.log(10>5<8)

// 9.) Add parenthesis to the following statement, the result should be 1
console.log((3 * 3 + 1) / (20 / 2) == 1); // This should log true
