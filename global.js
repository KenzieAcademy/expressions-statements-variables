// Welcome! Here's an example of a console logged response
console.log(4 + 5);

/***********************/
/* Using Expressions   */
/***********************/

//1.) Log an expression that evaluates to the sum of two integers
// your code here
let a = 13
console.log(a + 7);


// 2.) log an expression that evaluates to the difference of two integers
// your code here
let c = (-10)
console.log(c - (4));

// 3.) Log an expression that concatenates the two strings "I'm writing" and "my first JavaScript code"
// your code here
let d = "I'm writing"
let b = " my first JavaScript code"
console.log(d + b);

// 4.) Log an expression that evaluates to true or false using two numbers that are greater or less than eachother
// your code here
let e = 4
let f = 7
console.log(e > f);

// 5.) Log an expression that uses modulo, with a result of 4
// your code here
let g = 24
let h = 5
console.log(g % h);

// 6.) Create two different strings and compare them, logging the result.
// It should be false!
let i = 23
let j = 21
console.log( i < j);

// 7.) Concatenate 4 different strings to form the sentence "I'm learning a bit of JavaScript at Kenzie"
let k = "I'm learning"
let l = " a bit of"
let m = " JavaScript"
let n = " at Kenzie."
console.log(k + l + m +n);

//8.) Uncomment this code and create an expression inside of it.
//The expression should represent: 5 is less than 10 and 8 is greater than 5
//This should print true
let o = 5
let p = 10
let q = 8

console.log(o < p && q > o)

// 9.) Add parenthesis to the following statement, the result should be 1
console.log((3 * 3) + 1 / (20 / 2) !== 1); 
// This should log true
